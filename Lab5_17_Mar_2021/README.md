Experiment: Create a BCD Arithemetic Unit (AU) that can add, subtract, and multiply two 4-bit BCD values entered via switches (division is optional). Additionally, the values entered should be displayed on two separate seven segment displays; a switch will control if the displays will show the raw value or the BCD value of the switches. The output of the AU should be held by an 8-bit register and displayed on seven segment displays.

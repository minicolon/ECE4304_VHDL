Experiment:
1) Create BCD converter unit that takes four input (SW) and produce BCD values (0-9) (Do your best in optimization part (Low number of resources and low-power consumes). 

2) Create a 7SEG decoder as we learnt from ECE3300 (convert the code to VHDL as a practice)

3) Use two units of the BCD one is connected to the first 7SEG from the left and the other connected to the nunmber 4 Digit

4) Define all possible corner cases in the report and your methodlogy before writing your testbench

Experiment: To create a system that utilizes both a VGA display and the UART protocol. The inputs to the system are 9 switches, 1 reset button, and the jtag port for serial UART data. The output is the VGA display with the appropriate parameters such as color and sprite/image. The UART data that is sent from the computer to the FPGA controls where the sprite will move around to on the VGA display. The switches are used to alter the color of the sprite.

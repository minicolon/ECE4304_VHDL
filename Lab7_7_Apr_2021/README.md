Experiment: Create a small system that utilizes the UART protocol, taking in the computers Tx data. The construction uses 2 debouncing circuits, 2 Rx units for each FIFO, 2 barrel shifters, 1 arithmetic unit (AU), and 1 display unit. The input to the system other than Tx data are a total of 6 switches, and 2 pushbuttons. The output of the data is 2 LEDs for when each fifo is empty, 2 LEDs for when each fifo is full, 4 Ssegs for the AU, 2 Ssegs for A barrel shifted, and 2 Ssegs for B barrel shifted
